-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul  9 17:25:25 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r4401: (version 0.105):
  - osc submitreq list:
     - can now be called without parameters, applying to the working copy then.
     - calling it in a project directory is also possible now.
     - output was improved. Newest requests are listed first.
  - osc submitreq delete: a new action which has been added
  - osc submitreq list/create: use api URL from the working copy
  - osc meta: editing returns the API error description instead of a plain HTTP
    error if available
  - osc copypac: use the correct userid when copying to another api host
  - osc importsrcpkg: disable signature check when getting data from a rpm file
  - osc linkpac: --revision option added.
  - osc search: added option -i|--involved, to show in which projects/packages

  - osc buildhist: change the output into a format which better matches actual
    RPM filenames.
  - osc commit: give commit message tempfiles a ".diff" suffix, so syntax
    highlighting automatically works in capable editors
  - other bug fixes:
    - don't expand/unexpand if the working copy has local modifications - this is
      an ugly workaround for bnc#399247 but this way the working copy isn't screwed up
    - work around a bug which causes packages to be cached locally under the
      "None" architecture (and therefore causing issues when building for more
      than one architecture via osc build).
    - don't create _linkerror files in working copies
    - better error handling (mostly printing more details) in a number of cases
    - show error messages from the API also for type 500 errors

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jun 11 10:34:53 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r4164 (version 0.104):

  - more/better error messages in some error scenarios
  - osc wipebinaries: add missing check for commandline arguments,
    which could cause a PACKAGE argument to be ignored
  - fixed make_diff in order to avoid errors when committing a new
    package (created with mkpac)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun  6 14:05:21 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r4120 (version 0.103):
  - osc submitreq create: simplify by make osc guess needed
    parameters, if there is a working copy and it is a source link.
  - osc submitreq create: don't stop on packages that have a devel
    project defined, if the submit actually comes from that
    project.
  - osc checkout: checkout of source links is now done in expanded
    form per default. The new option --unexpand-link can be used to
    get the raw link file.
  - show the API's error message for HTTP 403 (Forbidden) replies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun  3 17:15:26 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

    a guessed one.  Add --nodevelproject. 
  - osc submitreq: look up the develproject of the target, and if
    there is one, don't create the request, unless forced with
    --nodevelproject.
  - when -d (global, for debug) was used, save the body because it can't be read twice

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 27 12:54:26 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r4030:

  - improved error handling, when API returns HTTP status code 400 (bad request)
  - osc status: implement -q/--quiet switch
  - osc info: slightly more verbose
  - osc deletepac: allow deletion of multiple packages at once
  - make "osc meta prjconf <project> -e" work again (probably caused by r3702)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May 20 14:33:52 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r4002:
  - osc maintainer: new -D/--devel-project switch

  - facilitate correct syntax highlighting when editing metadata

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 19 17:14:45 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r3995:
  - version 0.100
  - improved error handling (babysitter.py wrapper, oscerr.py exception classes)
    Tracebacks are mostly suppressed now. To enable them, use
    |    -t, --traceback    print call trace in case of errors
    or set traceback=1 in .oscrc.
  - other new global options for debugging:
    |    --debugger         jump into the debugger before executing anything
    |    --post-mortem      jump into the debugger in case of errors
    |    -d, --debug        print info useful for debugging

    will have its own versioning in the future)
  - osc rprjresults and osc rresults: new commands to show remote build results
  - osc build: added --baselibs and --jobs options
  - osc copypac: added --keep-maintainers switch

    * OSC_SU_WRAPPER overrides the setting of su-wrapper.
    * OSC_BUILD_ROOT overrides the setting of build-root.
    * OSC_PACKAGECACHEDIR overrides the setting of packagecachedir.
  - a few bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr  2 16:36:40 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r3614:
  - osc commit: implement committing with keeping links (to commit
    changes to expanded links)
  - osc copypac: make the server-side copy the default. But do a
    client-side copy if source and target are not on the same
    buildservice instance

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr  1 09:43:12 CEST 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r3598:
  New features:
  - new link handling:
    add support for handling linked packages in expanded form. They
    can be checked out, updated (expanding or unexpanding them),
    and built locally.
    Missing: commit support.
    Newly introduced options are:
    * osc checkout: --expand-link 
    * osc update: --expand-link and --unexpand-link 
  - osc build: add --debuginfo switch (Thanks, Juergen!) [bnc#368524]
  - osc req: add option -a / --add-header to inject arbitrary
    request headers
  - osc addremove (and others): ignore _all_ dot files (the
    buildservice doesn't handle them) [bnc#370476]
  - copypac: do a server-side copy (via a single api call) when
    used with -s / --server-side. 
  - prjresults: csv export uses ';' as default (Pavol)
  - osc update/checkout: enable to use md5sum as revision id
  - osc info: make it show info about expanded and non-expanded links
  - osc submitreq:
    - implement an 'accept' action, resulting in the respective
      state change
    - when requesting a submit, save the source package's revision
      id (looking up what it currently is)
    - give the user a way to override it, to submit an older
      revision
    - when using show --diff, take the actual old revision into
      account. Thus, the diff is against the source revision of the
      time of request creation.
  Bug fixes:
  - osc mkpac only works when 'do_package_tracking' is enabled
  - do_repos() should work in a project dir too
  - handle mmap failure on filesystems like NTFS, which may not
    support memory mapping when mounted under Linux
  - submitreq show: if the target package doesn't exist, a diff
    cannot be produced.
  - fixed username issues when creating a new package (the problem was
    that the username for the default host was used and not the one for
    that specific apiurl)
  Internal changes:
  - enhance osc.core.makeurl(). This function accepts a query
    parameter in form of a list. The query can now also be given as a
    dictionary, and in that case it will be automatically urlencoded.
    The behaviour for a list is unchanged for the reason of backward
    compatibility.
  - add Linkinfo class to osc.core
  - Package class: 
    - add linkinfo when reading in package data via update_datastructs()
    - add islink() and isexpanded() methods
  - added 3 new methods:
    * createPackageDir(): creates and initializes a new package dir in
      the given project.
    * get_apiurl_usr(): returns the username for a certain apiurl
    * get_configParser(): returns an ConfigParser() object which can be
      used for parsing the ~/.oscrc file
  - new show_upstream_xsrcmd5() method which returns the xsrcmd5 (if a
    linkinfo element exists)
  - all necessary auth-information are available in the 'auth_dict'
    (so there's no need to fool around with the ConfigParser...)
  - if there are no credentials for the apisrv in use (which may be
    specified with -A on the commandline), don't try to set up
    config['user'] with credentials.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 10 19:15:11 CET 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r3492:
 - new feature: package tracking. It's not enabled by default and
   needs to be switched on with do_package_tracking=1 in .oscrc.
   before using. See
   http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/2008-03/msg00114.html
   for more info.
 - new command submitreq, to handle "submit requests" (next
   generation build service feature). Its functionality isn't
   complete yet. So far it can create, list and show requests.
 - define bugowner when creating new projects or packages

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar  4 09:47:51 CET 2008 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r3403:
  - fixes from Marcus and Michal Marek:
  - fix importsrcpkg when $projectdir/.osc/_apiurl is an
    alternative apiurl
  - added optional apiurl parameter to the following methods:
    meta_exists, make_meta_url, checkRevision if no apiurl
    parameter is specified the global value (conf.config['apiurl'])
    will be used. This should fix bug #361764
  - some small apiurl fixes in the make_diff method (the
    package_tracking branch already has this fix)
  - added option --csv to 'osc prjresults' to output a CSV table
  - small fixes testsuite for the testsuite

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jan 24 19:36:59 CET 2008 - poeml@suse.de

    - add --no-verify
    - add --local-package to build a package which doesn't exist on the server
    - add --alternative-project to specify a project, if the current one doesn't
      exist on the server
    - use api url from .osc/_apiurl [#355144]
  - new command remotebuildlog
  - diff: fix #347377 (diffing too many files)

  - fix prjresults for newly added packages, where build status is
    missing
  - internal changes:
    - copied init_project_dir() method from the
      osc-package-tracking branch (just removed the
      do_package_tracking stuff)
    - changed the storedir attribut of the Package() class to an
      absolute filename - normally this shouldn't have any impact
      on existing methods, functionality etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  - maintainer:
    - added --verbose option
    - added functionality to add/remove users from a project/package

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep  3 12:47:31 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r2075:
  - new 'maintainer' command, to list the maintainers of a project
    or package
  - make osc call build with --changelog option, by default [#298436]
  - make osc library simpler to use from external scripts, by
    simply calling conf.get_config(), with possibility to override
    conf file, http debugging, api server). It is no longer
    required to set up the api url in the config dict, and call
    conf.init_basicauth().
  - allow to specify a different config file via the environmental
    variable OSC_CONFIG, or via -c|--config on the commandline

-------------------------------------------------------------------

    judas_iscariote for spotting this issue, and Marcus for fixing
    it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug  8 20:49:24 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1946:
  - avoid warning/error with unsupported HTTPS_PROXY [#214983][#298378]
  - importsrcpkg:
    * changed default behaviour - the files will not be committed by
      default. To commit them use the --commit switch.
    * added --delete-old-files option switch to delete old files from
      the server.
    * allow to import source rpms by specifying an URL
    * use rpm-python
  - fix for "osc prjconf <project> -e".
  - add Recommends: rpm-python

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 25 13:04:37 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1884:
  - added new importfromsrcpkg command, to import a package src.rpm
    (we owe this to Marcus)
  - added new req command, to issue arbitrary requests to the API
  - append missing newline if do_commits=False [#293672]
  - make delete_package() and delete_project() more userfriendly
    (added trivial exception handling..)
  - expand ~ to users home for packagecachedir in .oscrc [#293675]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jul 19 14:28:51 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1871:
  - meta: allow for editing patterns
  - small fixes:
    - fix error message which osc issues if build package is too old
    - results: result code can be empty when package has just been created
    - fix name of 10.2 product in the template for new projects

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 18 15:21:48 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1861:
  - commit (using the currently documented way): 
    - do DELETEs _before_ generating an "upload" revision with
      PUTs. The DELETEs would be invalidated by the commit.
    - switch to new commit mode also if the -F switch is used
    - flush stdout, so that the progress dots are seen directly
      when being written

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 16 18:30:18 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1846:
  - added initial search support (some ideas are taken from the webclient):
     * when searching a package/project it
       is also possible to search for the search term
       in the <title /> and <description /> elements of
       a package/project.
     * show only exact matches
  - new meta command, replacing editmeta, editprj, createprj,
    editpac, createpac, edituser. Can either show existing meta, or
    edit it (--edit), or upload content (--file). Fix metadata
    change detection, which no longer relies on the timestamp of
    the temporary file.
  - log:
    - renamed previous "log" command to "buildlog" (short: bl)
    - implementing a log command to review the commit log
  - commit:
    - commit: implemented -m and -F option for the commit message.
      NOTE: if -m is used, osc uses a different mode of uploading
      files and commit them, namely the way which is currently
      documented in the api. So far, osc was uploading each file
      separately through the old backward compatible way. This way
      of committing can also be forced with do_commits = 1 in
      .oscrc.
  - other changes:
    - api now sends HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request for invalid xml. Thus,
      show the reply body because it contains helpful info.
    - if PUT on metadata fails with a 500, and http_debug is True,
      print out the body of the server reply
    - improved exception handling in some places
    - updatepacmetafromspec: read spec files in utf-8, or whatever
      the preferred encoding is in the locale

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Jul 11 11:20:24 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1825:
  - version 0.97
  - added initial revision handling:
    - extended "osc co prj pac" to checkout a specific revision of pac
    - extended "osc up" to update to a specific revision
    - extended "osc diff" to diff the working copy against a
      specific revision on the server. NOTE: comparing two
      server-side revisions (osc diff -r 11:12) is currently
      not supported!
  - addremove: ignore foo.rXX, foo.mine for files which are in 'C' state
  - wipebinaries: allow to wipe all binaries of packages for which
    the build is disabled
  - updatepacmetafromspec scans for spec files automatically; also,
    added a --specfile option.
  - load subcommands from /var/lib/osc-plugins/ or ~/.osc-plugins/

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 16:05:45 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- add /var/lib/osc-plugins to the filelist

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 14:05:00 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

  - rm: don't allow to mark files as deleted which are not under
    version control

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 28 16:19:07 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1792:

    edit_meta() is called with change_is_required=False.
  - log: fail gracefully if logfile can't be found
  - handle empty prjresults (e.g. when no repositories are defined)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Jun 26 15:22:08 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1783:
  - build: don't stumble over an empty list of packages when trying to verify packages
  - ls: add verbose option to print extra information for packages
  - for ls, co, meta, editmeta, linkpac, copypac, rebuildpac, and wipebinaries
    (basically all the server-side commands), allow arguments "foo/bar" instead
    of "foo bar"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 22 15:23:24 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1769:
  fix return values in metafile.sync() which I broke whey I applied
  Marcus Huewe's patch...

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 21 17:15:54 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1763:
  - set correct Content-Type header on PUT requests
    (application/octet-stream). Rails 1.2 seems to be more strict
    in this regard. Patch from Marcus Rueckert.
  - init: make usage (and usage info) info more precise

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 14 16:31:30 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1733:
  New features kindly implemented by Marcus Huewe:
  - added wipebinaries command
  - added abortbuild command
  - improved handling of metadata editing if the server doesn't accept it

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Jun 14 10:36:07 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1731:
  - adjust for change in build.rpm, where /usr/lib/build/debsort
    was removed.  Look for debtransform program instead in order to
    determine if build.rpm is new enough.
  - update cmdln.py to planned 1.0 version. The main changes are
    related to points that were raised during employment in osc:
      # v0.8.3
      - Fix a bug where errors with passing an incorrect number of args to
        functions in do_foo() implementations would be masked.
      # v1.0.0
      - [backward incompat] `Cmdln.main()` no longer takes an `optparser`
        argument. Top-level option parsing has been changed so that top-level
        options for a `Cmdln` subclass can more naturally be defined and
        handled on the class definition. Changes:
        - `Cmdln.main()` calls `self.get_optparser` to get an option handler.
          Subclasses should overload this method for custom top-level options.
        - After option parsing, but before sub-command handling, the
          `self.postoptparse()` hook is called.
      - Add a `version` attribute on `Cmdln` subclasses. If set, the default
        top-level option parser will have a `--version` attribute.
      - [backward incompat] Simplify the StopProcessing/opts.stop handling for
        option handling in subcommands. The "opts" argument to "do_*"
        sub-command functions will no longer have a "stop" value.
        StopProcessing is now called StopOptionProcessing. This shouldn't
        affect simple usage of cmdln.py.
    - adjust osc.commandline for these changes.
  - make startdir a module global
  - add info about usage with the 'nosetests' test discovery tool
  - add tests for commandline options
  - results: remove obsolete code handling commandline arguments

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon May 14 12:13:00 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1657:

    the specfile's content, not its name... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May 10 16:33:57 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1652:

    the backend
  - use new API route for downloading binaries also in configured URLs
  - make deletepac work again

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat May  5 00:02:55 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1635:
  - version 0.96
  - following suggestions by Christian Boltz and Michal Marek, osc
    now memorizes where a working copy was checked out from, saving
    the api server url to .osc/_apiurl. 
  - implement 'info' subcommand
  - buildhistory works again
  - copypac: implement package copy from one buildservice instance to another
    (--to-apiurl option)
  - build:
    - rename --prefer-pacs option to --prefer-pkgs
    - implement --keep-pkgs option
    - call rpm command for preferred rpms with --nosignature --nodigest
    - improve key import instructions after suggestion by Michael Wolf
  - the results subcommand now handles multiple <working copy> arguments

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  2 20:20:12 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1626:
  - build: implement --prefer-pacs option
  - apply patch from Michael Marek, fixing all places where error
    messages were printed to stdout instead of stderr. [#239404]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Apr 25 19:32:18 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1608:
  - version 0.95
  - osc is now easier to work with when using alternative API servers. The
    configured server can be overriden with -A <url> on the commandline.
    "apisrv" in the config takes a URL now, so the variable "scheme" which was
    needed in addition before becomes obsolete. For backward compatibility, a
    hostname (and scheme variable) are accepted like before. Likewise, the auth
    sections in the config take a URL now, or a hostname:port to keep old config
    working. HTTP or HTTPS scheme is determined from the URL. Credentials must be
    configured in .oscrc.
  - build: use actual api server in urllist for downloading, instead of hardcoded
    api.opensuse.org [#265211].
  - finally, global option -H enables HTTP traffic debugging
  - implement "rebuild all failed packages", via --failed option in rebuildpac
    subcommand
  - status -v shows all files, including unmodified ones
  - suppress the legend in prjresults by default (show with -l)
  - --version shows the program version number
  - fix the commit subcommand's argument handling. The following works correctly
    now: osc ci ../test/onlyinwc `pwd` fstab ../test/f2
  - fix the download progress meter to work with small terminals [#266989]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 20 02:09:11 CEST 2007 - poeml@suse.de

- update to r1594:
  - save and reuse HTTP server cookies, speeding HTTP requests up
    about 5 times (in our iChain setup anyway...)
  - rewrite the HTTP handling
    - adding http_GET/POST/PUT/DELETE() functions, which dispatch to
      http_request(), and use them everywhere
    - removing othermethods.py 
    - keeping urlopen(), in case it is used from externally, but have it print out
      a "depracated" message
    - finally, implementing a global HTTP debug mode
    - if data to be sent is large, mmap it instead of reading at once
  - build: remove debug print of tempfile name
  - README: add info about dependencies of osc python module
  - further the osc buildroot configuration example

  authentication)
- add runtime check for build.rpm version, so the rpm package
  dependency is no longer required
- add 'edituser' command for editing the metadata of a user
  account. It tries to create a user if it doesn't exist yet. A new
  command 'usermeta' replaces 'id' respectively 'userid'.
- rewrite configuration handling. Now the API server can be set in
  .oscrc
- ignore '.gitignore', '.pc', '*~' (now using filename matching
